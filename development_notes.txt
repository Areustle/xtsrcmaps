 - Updated the genz_malik and model_map modules to implement fastest numerical integral
   variant yet tested.
 - Rewrote the test_model_map_v2 test to handle the updated point_src_model_map_wcs
   function.
 - Refactored Earlier modules {fitsfuncs, irf, exposure, tensor_ops, bilerp, psf} to
   drop mdspan support and instead use Eigen::Tensors.
 - Updated unit tests for earlier modules to new paradigm.
 - Added correct scaling factor to functions for solid_angle, pixel_exposure and
   psf_map_integral_correction_factor.

Goals:

[.] Write tests for all model_map scaling factor functions.
  [x] PSF solid angle
  [x] PSF radius and fov
  [x] map_integral
  [x] exposure
  [x] correction_factors
  [x] final model_map
[x] Output data to fitsfile.

Longer Term Goals:
[.] User Input Configuration parfile support
[.] CALDB IRF support
[] Edisp Bins support
[] Diffuse source support
[] Extended source support
[] Composite source support
